This directory contains several soundfonts created by ripping the soundbank with Subdrag's N64SoundTool.

Generally, this is pretty much the exact representation of the soundbank as it can be found in the game itself (loop markers, root keys, instrument key ranges, etc... just in SF2 format). ADSR times might be adapted. For some instruments, modulators were added to make them have their Default Pitch Bend Range, as used in the game.

I've put them here, for having a central place to collectively make adjustments to these soundfonts, so playing back our beloved N64 tunes sounds more perfect.
